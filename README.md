# Fusion 360 Vent Maker
Create vents quickly and easily

Documentation to come later. For now:



#Usage
Select a sketch point to use as the center of the vent.
The sketch point must lie on a planar face (not a reference plane)
The face of the sketch will determine the component for the feature
The vent will be cut normal to the face up to the next face it encounters.

#TODO / Enhancements:
- Add ability to rotate vent
- Add suppoprt for Blind and Through All end conditions
- Significantly better error handling
- Display Flow Area in proper units and calculate for circular
- Defer preview checkbox to handle slow updates
- Add more vent types and patterns
